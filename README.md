# Loose Comparison with Null and Undefined in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript involving loose comparison (==) and the handling of null and undefined values. The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.js` provides an improved solution.

The issue stems from the fact that loose comparison does not always behave as expected when comparing null and undefined to other values. The example highlights potential confusion and unexpected behavior.  The solution emphasizes strict equality (===) to improve code clarity and predictability.
